Questions for product team:

#1: After selecting a date (Nov 20 2021),  select "Model UN" from filter by Organization dropdown. I have two event types Speaker and Alumni, I am not sure of the expected behavior but when I select "Speaker" from filter by Event type drop down "No Results found" is the observed output.

It would be nice if Speaker event from Model UN organization are displayed

#2: Show academic events has just YES or NO. For the date Dec 1 2021, there are 2 events in total but only one event is displayed when date is selected. Is that (how academic events has just YES or NO) feature intentional? Because, when I select Yes, I could see 2 events.

#3: In the event types, only 4 kinds of events are present in the drop down. But there are events like "Community", "Type with conditional", "Facult" are not present in the dropdown. Is that expected?

#4: How are we distinguishing Academic and Non academic events. Is it by just by Event type ?

#5. In the Request Event, Speaker and Alumni are present. But there is no difference in that forms. Is that feature added as a future scope ?
